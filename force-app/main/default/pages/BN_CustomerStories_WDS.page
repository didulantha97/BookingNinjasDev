                                    <p>There’s a need for businesses in the industry to transition from legacy systems to adapt to modern and necessary ways of interacting and handling guests, transactions and creating convenience to their customers. </p>
                                    <p>The willingness and ability for companies to embrace and adapt quickly will be the key challenges to overcome in the near future.  This challenge also presents an opportunity to greatly improve experiences, and to create and maintain a competitive advantage as well as make more profits.</p>

                                    <p>We eliminate the need to have to merge several solutions to achieve tasks. We integrate different relevant solutions together through strategic partnerships and collaborations. Our partnership with Salesforce gave us their CRM and AI expertise. Partnership with Twilio gave us their rapid and efficient communication tools, helping you maintain better relationships with your customers.</p>

                                    <p>We are going along with the most recent way of serving applications: cloud-based services. We believe restriction to local installations will be stressful and expensive as you would have to manually install the application on every staff computer. There is also the issue of security: a cloud-hosted application is more secure from attacks than when there is a copy of the application on multiple systems.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>Integration of third-party tools</h2>
                                    <p>How’s that? By using the Booking Ninjas application, businesses have been able to gain access to apps from the AppExchange platform, by Salesforce, and integrate them into the Booking Ninjas system, like a whole application. This has reduced the stress of looking for apps that could perform auxiliary functions. Another advantage it has brought to users is the limitless functionalities apps from the AppExchange platform can bring to a business.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                    <p>The perfect Property Management System for your business is one that can deliver desired results and not just that, but also ensure you get the results.
