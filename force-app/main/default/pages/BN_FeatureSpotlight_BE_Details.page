                    <h2>What does Booking Engine mean for Hospitality Sector?</h2>
                    <p> A booking engine is a system that is integrated into the business industry’s website and social media platforms to ensure that guests can book an online reservation without stress. In other words, a booking engine is a software solution that allows business organizations, particularly the ones in the hospitality realm, to sell their rooms via their website or social media platforms, e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc., your hospitality is listed on. </p>
                    <p>A booking engine is so effective in expanding the customer base since it makes it relatively easier to browse through the available vacancies in the hospitality industry and then make a commission-free direct booking, which is one of the measures taken by renowned business organizations to optimize property’s sales strategy, and ultimately maximize revenue. </p>
                    <p>It is no news that we now live in a world where technology evolves every day, and as that happens, more people do not want to be left out, so why should you?
