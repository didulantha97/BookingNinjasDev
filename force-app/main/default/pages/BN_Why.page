                        <p>Technology has had a larger impact on society than any other industry in the world. It has changed the way we interact with each other and more importantly, how we do business. And the business that cares most about satisfying members of society? The hospitality industry. As we've explained in some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/bookingninjas" class="blue" target="_blank">previous videos</a> on our YouTube channel, property managers need to be open to the idea of fully integrating technology into their business operations in order for their company to adapt to the 4th Industrial Revolution. </p>
                        <p>Here are some of the reasons why Booking Ninjas is considered the best property management software in the hospitality business. </p>

                                    <h2>Mobility</h2>
                                    <p>As the baby boomer generation grows older, it has become paramount for any property management company to offer an efficient mobile interface to serve their customer base. Booking Ninjas’ property management software is the best way for hoteliers and other commercial property managers to consolidate the various aspects of running their business and optimize their company to better serve their clientele. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p> All you have to do is go to any public place and you'll see more than half of the people you encounter looking at their phones. For better or worse, mobile technology is here to stay and as a property manager, you need to have a business model that fits the time we're living in. Some neat features that PMS mobility offers include mobile keys, faster check-in, management flexibility, smart guest experiences, and many more. Having a strong mobile platform also allows you to reach more customers and increase direct bookings. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Einstein AI</h2>
                                    <p>Something that is becoming more frequent each year is the use of artificial intelligence in the hospitality industry. At some hotels, robots act as your concierge, delivering towels, toiletries, and even food and beverages directly to your room. A lot of people have a fear and paranoia of AI, but the truth is, it can be very beneficial to your property and the growth of your business. 
    
                                        </p>
                                    <p>Case and point: Salesforce’s Einstein AI analytics. Einstein was built specifically for a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, so it is able to personalize its data and analytic reports to your property. Einstein AI can identify significant patterns and trends that you can act on. This helps you see the weaknesses and potential threats to your business. By utilizing Einstein AI to its fullest capabilities, there will be no excuse for you not to better your company moving forward. By having unlimited access to the proprietary, easy-to-use Salesforce Einstein AI, Booking Ninjas is the only PMS solution that delivers out of the box apps, point-and-click solutions, programmatic services,and machine learning to help better serve your staff and guests.</p>

                                    <p>In 2015, Booking Ninjas became the first and only property management business to become a Salesforce partner through its app innovation program, resulting in a large influx of new customers. They are offering to reach out a hand to those in the property business who’ve had trouble adapting to the technological revolution we’re living in now. With a firsthand perspective of how to drive business on a mobile platform, the Salesforce consultants at Booking Ninjas offer the advice property managers need to grow their business.

Since then, they’ve encouraged property managers to utilize their PMS on a cloud-based platform. By implementing the cloud, businesses can be assured that their company data is secure rather than risking storing it on a single hard drive. </p>

                                    <p>   Furthermore, you can encourage direct feedback from your mobile-friendly cloud-based platform. More importantly, taking advantage of Salesforce Einstein AI, you can view in-depth customer preferences before they arrive at your hotel. The AI can also help improve your customer service by bringing up customer interaction history when a particular customer calls the property, so the agent has a better understanding of what call may pertain to.

Luckily, we're one step ahead of you. With a Booking Ninjas PMS property, you can control which accounts have access to specific  data on the platform. Make newly promoted staff members feel extra empowered by giving them unlimited access to the software and limit the access capability of those you don’t feel are ready to view the information.
