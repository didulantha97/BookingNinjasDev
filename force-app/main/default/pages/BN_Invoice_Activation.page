If You wish to use the SFDC Service or any of its functionalities or services other than those included in the Reseller Application, or to create or use additional custom objects beyond those which appear in the Reseller Application in the form that it has been provided to You by Your Reseller, visit www.salesforce.com to contract directly with SFDC for such services. In the event Your access to the Reseller Application provides You with access to the SFDC Service generally or access to any Platform or SFDC Service functionality within it that is in excess of the functionality described in the Reseller Application&rsquo;s user guide, and You have not separately subscribed under a written contract with SFDC for such access, then You agree to not access or use such functionality, and You agree that Your use of such functionality, or Your creation or use of additional custom objects in the Reseller Application beyond that which appears in the Reseller Application in the form that it has been provided to You by your Reseller, would be a material breach of this Agreement.

                        <br />
                        <p>This Agreement consists of (a) Subscription and License Agreement, (b) Purchase Order No.{!item.quoteNumber} (the <strong>&ldquo;Purchase Order&rdquo;</strong>) and its Addendum A, and (c) the SFDC Service Agreement.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>This Agreement governs your use of the Booking Ninjas Comprehensive Property Management Application (the <strong>&ldquo;Application&rdquo;</strong>). By using, downloading, or subscribing to use the Application, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you refuse to accept any of the terms and conditions herein, you will not be able to use the Application. Capitalized terms will have the meaning set forth herein, or, if not defined, as set forth in the SFDC Service Agreement.</p>
                        <br /><br />
                        <p><strong>1. Subscription.</strong> The Application is only available to individuals or organizations who have purchased an annual subscription from the Licensor (<strong>&ldquo;Subscription&rdquo;</strong>). A Subscription includes permission for one user to use the Application, subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Customer may purchase multiple Subscriptions to enable multiple users under its control to use the Application (each, an <strong>&ldquo;Authorized User&rdquo;</strong>) subject to the terms of this Agreement. The following terms apply to a Subscription:</p>
                        <br />

                            <li><span class="text_underline">Term of Subscription.</span> The initial term of a Subscription is for a period of one year, commencing on the date specified in the Purchase Order, unless terminated earlier pursuant to this Agreement (the <strong>&ldquo;Initial Term&rdquo;</strong>). The Subscription Term will automatically renew for additional successive one-year terms (each a <strong>&ldquo;Renewal Term&rdquo;</strong>) unless Customer terminates or cancels its Subscription at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or the Renewal Term, as the case may be, by contacting Licensor&rsquo;s customer service team at <a href="mailto:admin@bookingninjas.com">admin@bookingninjas.com</a>, or following Licensor&rsquo;s other written instructions for cancellation (the Initial Term and any Renewal Term(s) will be collectively referred to as the <strong>&ldquo;Term&rdquo;</strong>).
                        </li>
                            <li><span class="text_underline">Subscription Fee.</span> Customer will pay the fees set forth in the Purchase Order and any applicable add-on purchase orders that are agreed to during the Term, including without limitation the recurring annual subscription fee, and other charges and fees incurred in order to access and use the Application (such as increasing the number of Authorized Users) (the <strong>&ldquo;Subscription Fee&rdquo;</strong>). The Subscription Fee for a Renewal Term will be the same as the prior term, unless otherwise stated on the Purchase Order or if Licensor notifies Customer of a change to the Subscription Fee at least sixty (60) days before the commencement of the Renewal Term. All fees charged hereunder, including Subscription Fees, are final and non-refundable.
                        </li>
                            <li><span class="text_underline">Payment of Subscription Fee.</span> The Subscription Fee will be paid with a valid credit card or wire transfer of immediately available funds. Licensor will automatically charge Customer&rsquo;s credit card or debit Customer&rsquo;s account at the start of the Initial Term and at the start of each Renewal Term. If Customer and Licensor have agreed to installment payments, Customer will be charged or debited at the rate stated in the Purchase Order. If Licensor is unable to collect the Subscription Fee, Licensor may suspend or terminate Customer&rsquo;s Subscription and access to the Application without notice.
                        </li>
                            <li><span class="text_underline">Subscription Data.</span> Customer agrees to provide Licensor with certain information related to billing, the Application, the Subscription, or any Authorized User(s), including the names and contract information of all Authorized Users, and the Customer&rsquo;s name, address, telephone number, email address, and up-to-date billing information (<strong>&ldquo;Subscription Data&rdquo;</strong>). Customer represents and warrants that all Subscription is true, accurate, and complete. Customer understands and acknowledges that Licensor may share its Subscription Data with third parties for the purpose of verifying the information and collecting the Subscription Fee. Customer agrees to maintain and update the Subscription Data, as well as any other information provided to Licensor. Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, if Customer provides Licensor with information that is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, or Licensor has reasonable grounds to suspect that such is the case, in addition to any rights Licensor may have under applicable law, Licensor may suspend or terminate Customer&rsquo;s Subscription and access to the Application without notice.
                        </li>
                            <li><span class="text_underline">Taxes and Ancillary Fees.</span> In addition to the Subscription Fee, Customer is responsible for all charges and fees associated with connecting to and using the Application, including without limitation all internet service provider fees, computer equipment, sales taxes, and any other fees necessary to access and use the Application.

Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed to create a partnership or joint venture between the Parties. Any provisions which by their terms contemplate survival will survive termination of this Agreement. This Agreement, together with the SFDC Service Agreement, Purchase Order, and any attachments, exhibits or appendices, defines the entire agreement between the parties in connection with the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written with respect to the subject matter hereof. Each party acknowledges that it has not been induced to enter into this Agreement by any representations or promises not specifically stated herein. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. No modification to any provision of this Agreement will be binding unless in writing and signed by both parties. No waiver of any rights under this Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by the party to be charged. All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors, and assigns of the parties hereto. This Agreement may be executed electronically through an e-signature software, or in multiple counterparts and by facsimile signature, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one instrument.</p>
