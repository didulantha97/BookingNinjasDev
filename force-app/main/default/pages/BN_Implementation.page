                            <p>The Booking Ninjas system implementation is as easy as it gets. At Booking Ninjas, we consider it our responsibility to provide a good transition process (if there is an existing platform), or a smooth fresh implementation process. In this regard, we break down our implementation into phases, to make each process easy to follow and properly managed. </p>

This involves breaking down units of the solution into various departments in the organization. We then proceed in a manner as to not cause a massive disruption to the business operations of the client.</p>

                                    <P>Our booking engine acts as a fulfillment for your plans to improve on self-serving capabilities for your guests. Your guests can now, without your help, make customized reservations exactly how they want it. This also saves you time, and that of your guests, as they can quickly make reservations and pay for them with their credit cards. That means fewer emails and phone calls for your staff.</P>
                                    <P>You also get data. Our online bookings collect customer data and store them for you. This data can be further analyzed to decide on strategies and work on weak points in the business.</P>
                                    <P>Through the Booking Ninjas PMS, you can be able to add a professional touch to your customer acquisition flow, comparing and updating rates in simple clicks. This puts you ahead of the competition by a long shot.</P>

Booking Ninjas offers a unique feature that allows you to integrate apps from AppExchange and run them directly from the Booking Ninjas platform. This changes the limit of your Booking Ninjas operations to endless – you can do just about anything on it.</p>

                                <h2>What about transitioning?</h2>
                                <p>Some of our clients come from other management systems, so we are familiar with the reluctance to switch systems. It is seen as an expensive, risky project, and then decide they will be better off sticking to the old systems. Technology advancements changed all that.</p>
                                <p>Firstly, we offer a demo implementation of the system. The data could be test data or properly migrated from an existing platform. In that way, our clients see how much easier, faster, and more value it brings to the business. </p>
                                <p>Moreover, we understand there were other systems before us, and if we’re to win clients over, our transition process has to be very easy and less technical. We took care of the time-wasting processes, and by far, reduced the technicalities. Transitioning to Booking Ninjas is now a very simple process, and just to make sure it goes 100% right, we will be around to support clients in that.</p>
