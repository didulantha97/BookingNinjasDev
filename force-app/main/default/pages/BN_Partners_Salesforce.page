                                    <h2>Partnered with Salesforce: Connecting Your Business and Customers in a Whole New Way</h2>
                                    <p><i>Implementing a Salesforce PMS system enhances professional property management so businesses know their customers, personalize experiences, and win life-long fans.</i></p>
                                    <p>Knowing your customer is the lifeblood of the hospitality industry. Remembering a small detail about someone’s preferences can elevate their experience and turn them into a loyal advocate for your business. A professional PMS system should provide tools to engage with your guests (and potential guests) on a personal level by leveraging the collective knowledge of your employees, and Booking Ninjas’ partnership with Salesforce does just that.</p>

                                    <h2>Sales and Marketing</h2>
                                    <p>First impressions matter. A clean lobby and friendly smile have an immediate impact, but more and more customers are first “meeting” your business online. A platform like Booking Ninjas can help you with staffing and scheduling to ensure you're always putting your best foot forward in person, and Salesforce can do the same for your business in the digital space. Powerful AI tools such as&nbsp;<apex:outputLink value="{!URLFOR($Page.BN_FeatureSpotlight_Einstein)}" target="_blank">Einstein Analytics</apex:outputLink> can determine attractive price points for past and potential customers while analyzing buying habits to provide targeted marketing. By pairing these tools with your professional property management system, you can ensure that insights gained before a customer books their stay seamlessly flow through all stages of their experience with your business.</p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <h2>Customer Service</h2>
                                    <p>A customer found your business by searching for “hotels close to the airport.” When they check-in, you make note of their options to make sure they get to their flight on time. In a digital age, sometimes you lose access to the information that attracts customers to your business in the first place - but this is not so when you use a Salesforce PMS that allows information to flow from the first point of contact to checkout. Using these integrated systems means that you get to know your customers and that knowledge helps you to provide them with the services they need for their current stay and in the future.</p>
