                        <p>As we mentioned in our&nbsp;<apex:outputLink value="{!URLFOR($Page.BN_Data)}" target="_blank">Data Page</apex:outputLink>, data analysis is more important now than ever before. As it becomes more valuable, Fortune 500 companies will be increasingly looking to monetize data, through offering DaaS (Data-as-a-Service) - essentially charging you a subscription fee for access to advanced data and analytics. Data and analytics is what we do best. Our Booking Ninjas PMS has the backing of the industry leading CRM and solution finder, Salesforce. Our property management technology includes&nbsp;<apex:outputLink value="{!URLFOR($Page.BN_ArtificialIntelligence)}" target="_blank">Einstein AI</apex:outputLink> which gives you real-time data and analytics as well as smart suggestions for your hospitality business. But truthfully, because General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws are still relatively new, many of these money-hungry conglomerates don’t follow the guidelines to keep you and your company's data safe. And the exposure of your company’s private data could lead to the downfall of your business. This is why it is best to trust us with your sensitive data, a GDPR compliant company.                 </p>

                                <p>There are seven guiding principles the GDPR works by; lawfulness, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, confidentiality, and accountability. GDPR requires data controllers (companies that handle your sensitive data) not only abide by these regulations, but also demonstrate how they do. These regulations originated in the EU, which coincidentally is where a lot of our clientele is based. So we’ve been aware and abidant by GDPR policies since the regulation passed in May of 2018. Our hard-working team of software developers made sure that our PMS has built-in GDPR compliance, maintaining that our company can never abuse our power when handling your private data. And it’s not just protection for you, it’s protection for your clients. If your data is breached, so is there's. Trust is the leading component of running a successful hospitality business. Once you alleviate trust, you can expect to see your business suffer greatly.                             </p>

                                        <p>Several security experts have predicted that GDPR policies, or something similar to them, will soon spread to USA, Brazil, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, and Australia as quickly as by the end of 2020. The U.S. has already seen data mayhem recently with Facebook’s exposure of data, causing unrest in much of the population. </p>

The CCPA acts similarly in California to the way GDPR does to the EU. Experts predict at least 10 more states will soon follow suit in adopting their own data privacy laws. </p>
