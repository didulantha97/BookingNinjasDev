                                    <p>Instead of operating physically on the premises, the POS system manages its function online. This feature makes it easier for you to access information and payments from the system at any time and wherever is most convenient for you! Since it performs on the cloud, updates, and changes are monitored and sent to you in real-time, making the information transfer seamless and giving you everything you need to know.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, accessibility to our POS system online is one thing, but it is also available for use on mobiles or tablets. You will not need to be tied to a computer in order to monitor transactions, and you can take the program with you as you move around on the job. From a hostess managing table availability on a tablet to waitresses logging in orders on their mobile, you can even utilize this function for your employees to use. If you have to check something quickly, all you need to do is pull out your phone or tablet to access the information you need.</p>

                                        <p>Guests can tell you quite a bit about themselves; from their room orders to what they buy at the hotel restaurant, there is data to be gathered from the choices that guests make. Not only is this data easily accessible for you, but it is also analyzed by our system. Our smart technology uses the data collected to come up with predictive statistics and lets you know about possible marketing opportunities. </p>
                                        <p>Guests are also able to favorite their preferences, making it even more apparent as to the level of precision that our system can handle.</p>
                                        <p>Your future guests will even benefit from this software without even knowing it; its system on the client’s side is easily accessible and user-friendly. Being able to pay without the hassle or re-order a favorite are a few simple perks that will make your guests enjoy their stay just a little bit more.</p>

                                        <p>It even lets you control which staff members can access certain amounts of data. If you decide to let an employee be in the know about specific information the system has received, you can set the permission settings yourself and allow them access.</p>
